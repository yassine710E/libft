**libft** is a foundational C project from 42 School where I re-implemented a set of standard C library functions. This project helped me master **pointers, memory management, strings, arrays, linked lists, and C algorithms**.

## About

The goal of libft is to recreate a subset of the **C standard library**, including:

- Character checks and conversions
- String manipulation
- Memory operations
- Linked list operations (bonus)

This strengthens **C fundamentals** and understanding of low-level operations.
